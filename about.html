<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Torren and for the past six years I have been a music educator at a local charter school in Kissimmee Florida
  While at this position, I have taught numerous music classes including Band, Choir, Music Theory, Keyboard, and Theater. 
  It has been a great experience working and managing my own classroom of students. I hope that this experience
  will one day grant me access to teaching at the University level.

<p>My wife and I currently have only one child, a daughter, and my wife is looking to minimize the amount of work she needs to 
  do to help keep us afloat. This has led me into expanding my professional horizons and looking into new forms of work that might
  fit our needs better for this season of life. Web Development has become an intrest of mine and I look forward to growing in this
  area in the years to come
